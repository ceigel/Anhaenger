## Anhaenger Lighting

This is an Arduino project to provide lighting for a Bike trailer for children. 
The controller supports 3 light strips: 1 under the body with a blue side-to-side pattern and 2 light strips innen on each side of the sits. There are 2 buttons which can control the inside strips, with 3 different patterns, one for iddle, the other 2 changeable via double-click on the buttons. There is a speed sensors which controls the light pattern of the under-body light strip, when decelerating it changes to all-red. When no input from the buttons or from the speed sensor, the controller sleeps. It can be brought back via button presses.

The project contains also kicad files for a PCB. The PCB has support for one extra light strip and a light sensor.

The project also contains Fusion 360 and step files for 3D printing the box containing the PCB.
